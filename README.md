# Morrowind Character Generator (MWCG)

Unsatisfied with the existing offerings of Morrowind character randomisers, I decided to make my own

This generator uses actual NPC names from the UESP wiki to ensure lore friendly and (mostly) pronouncable names.

In addition there is a "sensible" character mode that tries to line up factions with your character, no more will you have barbarians joining the thieves guild.
